# HR-Data-Analytics
In this HR Analytics project, I created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize key employee metrics. The project involved integrating multiple datasets, developing KPIs for performance and satisfaction. Custom visuals and dynamic reporting features were used to provide actionable insights, helping HR managers make informed decisions.
